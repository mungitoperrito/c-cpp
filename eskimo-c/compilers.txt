It is a pain to find a host system that is old enough to run K&R C.  Instead, 
use the 2d edition of their book. That edition uses ANSI C.

For 32 bit ANSI C, prepare gcc like this:

    sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib

Then, compile like this:

    gcc -ansi -m32 program_name.c -o executable_name
